README for LS7366R Chip driver
Author/Contact: Aitor Hernandez <aitorhh@kth.se>

Description:

This project provides the chip implementation for the LS7366R SPI
external counter that could be attached to the mote with its 
connections
--------------------------------------------------

Contents:

Implementation in tos/chips/ls7366r
  - see README in that directory for implementation considerations
  
Platform dependent files in tos/platforms/telosb/chips/ls7366r

Test app in apps apps/TestCounter
  - see README for apps description
  
Documentation in docs/pdf
  - see ls7366r.pdf for description of the implementation and
    schematic and PCB board information

--------------------------------------------------

Environment setup:

set TOSCONTRIB to your contrib dir root.  i.e., for me:
$ export TOSCONTRIB=/home/aitorhh/workspace/tinyos-2.x-contrib-kth/

You can then build using ls7366r with a 
$ make telosb
