libcoap: A C implementation of IETF Core Application protocol

Copyright (C) 2010 by Olaf Bergmann <bergmann@tzi.org>

libcoap is a C implementation of a lightweight application-protocol
for devices that are constrained their resources such as computing
power, RF range, memory, bandwith, or network packet sizes. This
protocol, CoAP, is developed in the IETF working group "Constrained
RESTful Environments (core)", see <http://6lowapp.net>.

This directory contains a protocol parser and basic networking
functions for platform with support for malloc() and BSD-style
sockets. The examples directory contains a client and a server to
demonstrate the use of this library. 

Ports to other IP stacks such as Contiki/uIP/RIME or TinyOS/BLIP exist
as well but are (currently) not part of this distribution.
