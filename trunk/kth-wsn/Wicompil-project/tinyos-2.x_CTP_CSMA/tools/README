This directory contains the tinyos tools that are distributed in the
tinyos-tools package.

To install the tinyos tools from SVN, you must first prepare the
configure scripts here and in platforms/mica/uisp:
  ./Bootstrap
  (cd platforms/mica/uisp;./bootstrap)

Then you can configure, make and install as usual:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
