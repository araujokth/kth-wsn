DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------

This is the mote connected to the PC. It receives data from the 
EDReceiver mote. To run the experiment we need to create a sf on
this mote, and run LabView.

To program the mote use the following command:

make tmote install,X bsl,/dev/ttyUSBY

where X does not matter, because we fix the ID manually in the
header file. Y is the port number where the mote is connected.

All the steps are explained on the document "Wireless Crane
Event-Triggered Control" by Aitor Hernandez, Faisal Altaf and
Jose Araujo
