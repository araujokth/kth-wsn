Description
-----------------------------------

To compile this application I recommend to replace the seriallisten.c (after previous
backup) file from this folder to the support/sdk/c/sf that you have in yout TinyOS tree.

This scripts has been used and compile for Linux. And I recommend use it in Linux.

Usage
-----------------------------------
To running an store the data, we simply create a output redirection in the terminal 
as follows:

./seriallisten /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 > /home/kthwsn/workspace/apps.crane/matlab/sf_output/data_
