DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------

The sensor for the motes includes the driver implementation
to read from the LS7336R SPI counter. The SPI counter is used
to increase the precision of reading the encoder. 

When the encoder is read, the mote transmits a packet to the 
controller.

For more information, read the document "Wireless Inverted
Pendulum" by Aitor Hernandez, Joao Faria and Jose Araujo.
It is placed in the folder docs/ of this project. Extra
information is in the README files of the applications.
