Description
--------------------------------------------------
The BaseStation has the role of coordinator and manager of the network. It
is also connected to the PC, which computes the scheduler.

It is important to select a "good mote" to have this role, because for this
application we use the GTS mechanism which requires a precision in the timer.

In this application we have communication between:

i) IEEE 802.15.4
	a. It receives message from all the Water Tanks sensors
	b. It sends message to all the Water tanks actuators
	
ii) Serial communication
	a.  At the end of each superframe, it send information about the Water Tanks to
		the computer.
	b. Before the end of the superframe, it receives information about the new assignment
