@title README Controller app

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------
This application implements a centralized controller who manage
all the water tanks in the network.

Different options has been shown in the general README file
(CentralizedControllerGeneral/README)

The controller computes the voltage for the pump motor in V. But 
the value that we send to the actuator in the conversion to DAC units, 
following the next equation:

DAC = 273 * V

The control law tries to stabilize the upper tank level to the given
reference by following the next formula:

Vmotor = upperTank * (-0.6002) + lowerTank * (-0.0021) + integral*(0.1)
