@title README Actuator app

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------
This application shall be the actuator mote. Once in the controller,
we press the "User button" and the Sensor in connected, the controller
shall close the Wireless loop by sending the voltage value back to
the Actuator node. If a packet has successfully received the GREEN LED
blinks, otherwise, if there is an error the RED LED blinks.

The actuator node has to have an ID = 2 * WT_NUMBER, otherwise he
will not receive the packets of his process.

In the PCB board the actuator node corresponds to the bottom one.

Different options has been shown in the general README file
(CentralizedControllerGeneral/README)

The output of the mote follows the next equation:
Vmote = 0.0006151*DAC + 0.0009710 [V]

To simplify we will use 
Vmote = 4096 / 2.5 * DAC [V]

And then the circuit build in the PCB does:

Vmotor = 6 * Vmote

In conclusion we could assume that

Vmotor = 4096/15  * DAC [V]
