 * The microphone on the mica sensor board has two methods for control and
 * one method to read the binary output of the tone detector.  (Note:  The tone
 * detector's binary output can be configured as an interrupt.  Please see MicInterrupt.ti)
 *
 * muxSel allows users to switch the ADC to sample from phase lock loop output of
 * the tone detector (by setting the value to 0 (default))  or the raw voice-band output 
 * of the micrphone (by setting the value to 1).
 *
 * gainAdjust allows users to adjust the amplification gain on the microphone. The range
 * is 0 to 255 with 0 being the minmum and 255 being the maximum amplification.  Note that
 * setting amplification too high can result in clipping (signal distortion).
 *
 * If an audio signal at 4.3kHz is picked up by the microphone, the tone
 * detect will decode it and generate a binary ouput (0 meaning tone is detected, 1 meaning
 * tone is not detected).  Users can read this output simply by calling readToneDetector().
