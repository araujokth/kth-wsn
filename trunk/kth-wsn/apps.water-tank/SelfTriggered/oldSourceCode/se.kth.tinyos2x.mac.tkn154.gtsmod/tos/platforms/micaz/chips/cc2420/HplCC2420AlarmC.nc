/**
 * A platform independent abstraction of an asynchronous 32KHz, 16-bit
 * timer for the CC2420. As these timers (the Alarm interface) are
 * usually part of an HAL, they are platform specific. But as the
 * CC2420 needs to be cross-platform, this component bridges between
 * the two, providing a platform-independent abstraction of
 * CC2420-specific Alarm. This is a Atmega128 implementation that
 * uses the Compare1A register.
