Stargate SSP driver 

INSTALLATION

This directory should contain a precompiled version of the Stargate
SSP driver (stargate_ssp.o) for STARGATE Version 5 (linux 
version 2.4.19-rmk7-pxa1). If not, see the instructions on COMPILING
below. 
To install the driver, copy 'stargate_ssp.o' and 'ssp_load.sh' to a
directory on your Stargate platform. Execute 'ssp_load.sh' to install
the driver.  NOTE: As of this version, you will need to run this
script each time you reboot the stargate to reload the driver.

COMPILING

Edit the 'KERNELDIR' variable in 'Makefile' to point to your Stargate
kernel tree.  Then execute 'make'.
