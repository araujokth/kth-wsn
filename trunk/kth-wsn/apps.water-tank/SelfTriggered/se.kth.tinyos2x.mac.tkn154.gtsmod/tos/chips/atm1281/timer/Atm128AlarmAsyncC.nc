/**
 * Build a 32-bit alarm and counter from the atmega1281's 8-bit timer 2
 * in asynchronous mode. Attempting to use the generic Atm128AlarmC
 * component and the generic timer components runs into problems
 * apparently related to letting timer 2 overflow.
 * 
 * So, instead, this version (inspired by the 1.x code and a remark from
 * Martin Turon) directly builds a 32-bit alarm and counter on top of timer 2
 * and never lets timer 2 overflow.
