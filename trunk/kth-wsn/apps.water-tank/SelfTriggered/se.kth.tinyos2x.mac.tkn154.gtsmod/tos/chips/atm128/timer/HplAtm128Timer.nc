/**
 * Basic interface to the hardware timers on an ATmega128.  
 * <p>
 * This interface is designed to be independent of whether the underlying 
 * hardware is an 8-bit or 16-bit wide counter.  As such, timer_size is 
 * specified via a generics parameter.  Because this is exposing a common 
 * subset of functionality that all ATmega128 hardware timers share, all 
 * that is exposed is access to the overflow capability.  Compare and capture
 * functionality are exposed on separate interfaces to allow easy 
 * configurability via wiring.
 * <p>
 * This interface provides four major groups of functionality:<ol>
 *      <li>Timer Value: get/set current time
 *      <li>Overflow Interrupt event
 *      <li>Control of Overflow Interrupt: start/stop/clear...
 *      <li>Timer Initialization: turn on/off clock source
 * </ol>
