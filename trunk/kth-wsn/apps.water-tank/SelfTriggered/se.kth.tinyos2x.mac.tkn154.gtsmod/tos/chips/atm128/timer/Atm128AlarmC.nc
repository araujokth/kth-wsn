/**
 * Build a TEP102 Alarm from an Atmega128 hardware timer and one of its
 * compare registers.
 * @param frequency_tag The frequency tag for this Alarm
 * @param timer_size The width of this Alarm
 * @param mindt The shortest time in the future this Alarm can be set
 *   (in its own time units). Has to be at least 2, as setting a compare
 *   register one above the current counter value is unreliable. Has to be
 *   large enough that the Alarm time does not pass between the computation
 *   of <code>expires</code> and actually setting the compare register.
 *   Check this (for high-frequency timers) by inspecting the generated
 *   assembly code...
