Description
--------------------------------------------------

This application is for the actuator mote. This mote will give the 
voltage to the board, and it will be driven to the pump motor.

When we prees the press the "User button" in the Controller and the
Sensor in connected, the controller shall close the Wireless loop
by sending the voltage value back to the Actuator node.
If a packet has successfully received the GREEN LED blinks, otherwise,
if there is an error the RED LED blinks.

The actuator node has to have an ID = 2 * WT_NUMBER, otherwise he
will not receive the packets of his process.

In the PCB board the actuator node corresponds to the bottom one.

The output of the mote follows the next equation: we use
Vmote = 0.0006151*DAC + 0.0009710 [V]

To simplify we will use 
Vmote = 4096 / 2.5 * DAC [V]

And then the circuit build in the PCB does:

Vmotor = 6 * Vmote

In conclusion we could assume that

Vmotor = 4096/15  * DAC [V]
