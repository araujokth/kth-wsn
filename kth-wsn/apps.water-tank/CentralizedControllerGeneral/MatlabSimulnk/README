@title README file for Simulink model

DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------
For showing result in this example, we run a simulink model.
This model listens the TCP/IP port 9002 from the localhost where we should have 
the SerialForwarder running. 
Once we finish the experiments, we shall have the result in the workspace as two 
variables {wt, pck}.

1. Run the SerialForwarder
	$ sf 9002 /dev/ttyUSBXX tmote &
	
2. Run Simulink model and wait until the experiments has finished

RESULTS
--------------------------------------------------
To plot the results you could run 
> plotResults

or
> plotResultsAll

by selecting the different .mat files stored.
