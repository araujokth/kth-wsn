@title README file for the "SelfTriggered controller" scenario

Description
--------------------------------------------------
In this folder we find the code available to run the experiment with the
Self-Triggered Controller. 

Folders
--------------------------------------------------
apps/
	The code to compile the motes is placed in this folder. We have the code
	for the BaseStation, the actuator and sensor for the water tanks, a packet sniffer
	which analyse the communication performance of the network and links quality, and
	some dummy sensors.
	
matlab/
	This folder contains all the matlab code that we need. To start using the code, 
	execute the startup.m first.
	
oldSourceCode/
	The initial version of the "Self-triggered Controller" scenario was implemented to 
	work with only two water tanks by using Simulink. In our new implementation we
	could use N water tanks (with some restricctions) and it is done in Matlab.
