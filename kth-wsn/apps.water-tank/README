Options - Precompiler directives
--------------------------------------------------
WT_CALIBRATION ->
	In order to calibrate the water tanks use this precompiler directive:
		CFLAGS += -DWT_CALIBRATION
	This directive will give you some instruction in the terminal output, as we 
	see below.
	
	STEPS:
		0. Turn on, the Serial debug to see the printf's
		1. Disconnect the motor (unplugged "From Load" cable)
		2. Set both tanks to level ~0cm by adjusting the OFFSET resistor
		3. Fill the tank 1 (upper tank) to 25cm
		4. Set tank 1 to level ~25cm by adjusting the GAIN resistor
		5. Transfer the water to tank2
		6. Set tank 1 to level ~25cm by adjusting the GAIN resistor
