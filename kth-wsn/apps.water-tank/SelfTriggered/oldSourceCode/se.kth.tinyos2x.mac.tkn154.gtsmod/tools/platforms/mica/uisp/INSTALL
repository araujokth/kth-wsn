Installation for TinyOS-specific uisp:

Execute
  ./COMPILE
(you can run the commands it contains directly if you prefer)

Then:
  make install
(you must be root on Linux to perform this step)

WARNING: if you don't use the COMPILE script, you may get compilation
errors (depending on whether you've installed autoconf/etc, and what
versions you have)
