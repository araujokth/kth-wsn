 * The MagSetting inteface provides an asynchronous mechanism for
 * setting the gain offset for the Magnetometer on the mica sensorboard.
 * This is particularly useful in calibrating the offset of the Magnetometer
 * such that X and Y axis can stay in the center for idle signals.  
 * If not calibrated, the data you get may rail.  (railing means
 * the data either stays at the maximum (~785) or minimum (~240)). 
 *
 * The gain adjust has 256 steps ranging from 0 to 255.
