/**
 * Exposes Capture capability of hardware as general interface, 
 * with some ATmega128 specific dependencies including:
 *     Only available with the two 16-bit timers.
 *     Each Timer has only one dedicated capture pin.
 *         Timer1 == PortD.Pin4 [D4]
 *         Timer3 == PortE.Pin7 [E7]
 * So selection of 16-bit timer gives implicit wiring of actual Pin to capture.
