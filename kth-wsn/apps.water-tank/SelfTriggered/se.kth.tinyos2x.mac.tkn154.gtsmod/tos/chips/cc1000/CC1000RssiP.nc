/**
 *   RSSI fun. It's used for lots of things, and a request to read it
 *   for one purpose may have to be discarded if conditions change. For
 *   example, if we've initiated a noise-floor measure, but start 
 *   receiving a packet, we have to:<ul>
 *   <li>cancel the noise-floor measure (we don't know if the value will
 *     reflect the received packet or the previous idle state)
 *   <li>start an RSSI measurement so that we can report signal strength
 *     to the application
 *   </ul><p>
 *   This module hides the complexities of cancellation from the rest of
 *   the stack.
