/**
 * Hardware Abstraction Layer interface of Atmega128 for acquiring data
 * from multiple channels using the ATmega128's free-running mode.
 * <p>
 * Because of the possibility that samples may be imprecise after 
 * switching channels and/or reference voltages, and because there
 * is a one sample delay on swithcing channels and reference voltages,
 * M16c62pADCMultiple is complex. Two straightforward uses are:
 * <ol type="A">
 * <li>Acquire N samples from channel C:
 *    <ol>
 *    <li>call getData to start sampling on channel C at the desired rate
 *       (note that the choice of prescalers is very limited, so you
 *       don't have many choices for sampling rate)
 *    <li>ignore the first dataReady event
 *    <li>use the results of the next N dataReady() events, return FALSE
 *       on the last one
 *    </ol>
 * <li>Acquire one sample each from channels C1, ..., Cn (this pseudocode
 *    assumes that none of these channels are differential)
 *    <ol>
 *    <li>call getData to start sampling on channel C1
 *    <li>on the ith dataReady event switch to channel Ci+1 by changing
 *       *newChannel
 *    <li>the data passed to the ith dataReady event is for channel Ci-1
 *       (the data from the first dataReady event is ignored)
 *    </ol>
 * </ol>
