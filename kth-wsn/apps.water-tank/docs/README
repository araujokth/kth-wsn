DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------------------------
Voltage regulator U1 (LP3869 3.3V) provides +3.3V to power the motes
from +Vs (+12V) given by UPM.

The voltage signed from the sensor (through UPM) is divided by 3 with
a buffer on the input and another on the output to avoid impedance
missmatch.

The voltage signed from the D/A mote is fed to the UPM through a
buffer to avoid impedance missmatch.

The UPM will amplify this signal with gain 5 before applying it to the pump.
