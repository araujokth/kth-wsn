DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------

In this folder we find the applications that we need to
run the wireless inverted pendulum with the nonbeacon-enabled
mode of the IEEE 802.15.4, and the two links scenarios. In that
case we have sensos, controller an actuator motes.

Sensors -> Controller -> Actuator

So the controller only computes the control voltage and sends it
to the actuator.

For more information, read the document "Wireless Inverted
Pendulum" by Aitor Hernandez, Joao Faria and Jose Araujo.
It is placed in the folder docs/ of this project. Extra
information is in the README files of the applications.
