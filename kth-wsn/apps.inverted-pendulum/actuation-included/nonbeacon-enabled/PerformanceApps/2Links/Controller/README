DESCRIPTION
------------------------------------------------

This mote computes the control output. The computational
cost of the calculation is high and it only could be done
with the Zolertia mote which has more capabilites:
microprocessor and ram memory.

The control implemented has a Kalman filter to estimate
the samples due to the existent delay and an LQR controller.
More information regarding the modeling and controller is
written in the thesis: "Wireless Process Control using IEEE 802.15.4
" by Aitor Hernandez.

For more information, read the document "Wireless Inverted
Pendulum" by Aitor Hernandez, Joao Faria and Jose Araujo.
It is placed in the folder docs/ of this project. Extra
information is in the README files of the applications.
